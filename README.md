# Angled Peggle aimer

This repository currently only provides the web component and works as a **proof
of concept**. Using the web component with a back end to visualize chat's aim
should be easy, if not trivial, but that functionality is not provided here at
the moment.

## Usage

Since this repository contains the `.js` files generated by the TypeScript
compiler, trying the demo is as simple as navigating to the project's root
directory (same as `package.json`) and running a web server of your choice, a
simple example being Python's built-in http server module, executed via the
command: `python -m http.server`
